        <h1>Shaheed Sant Jarnail Singh Ji Khalsa Bhindranwale</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Arial Nova'">Sant Jarnail Singh Ji Khalsa Bhindranwala known as ‘Sant Ji’ was the 14th leader of the Damdami Taksal, a Sikh religious group based in Punjab India during the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. Sant Ji carried heavy influence amongst many Sikh youth in Punjab during this time as the leader of the Damdami Taksal. Sant Ji spread the original values of Sikhi and persuaded people young and old to follow the original rules and tenets of the Sikh religion.

          In 1981, Sant Ji was arrested for his suspected involvement in the murder of Lala Jagat Narain, the proprietor of the Hind Samachar Group. Although Sant Ji willingly surrendered to police (he was later released due to lack of evidence) he was kept on close watch by Indian police officials.

          Sant Ji is mainly notable for his involvement in the ‘Dharam Yudh Morcha’ alongside Sant Harchand Singh Longowal which was for the basic human rights of Punjabis stated within the ‘Anandpur Sahib Resolution’ and for the ‘Battle of Amritsar’ in June 1984, in which he and other defenders of the faith defended Sri Akaal Takht Sahib complex, including the Sri Darbar Sahib against the invading Indian army.

          In the days before the attack on Sri Harimandir Sahib, Sant Ji had denied the wishes of many Jhujaru Singh who had asked to stay within the complex and die as a martyr in the coming battle, this was done to help the Sikh struggle flourish after the attack on the Sikh throne. In the same way that the Sikhs in the Haveli at Chamkaur Sahib had voted for Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji Maharaj to escape and live to fight another day, Sant Ji  told his fellow defenders of the Faith that he will fight and defend the Sikh throne against the invading Indian army. All that had chosen to stay with Sant Ji to defend the Sri Akaal Takht Sahib and Sri Harimandir Sahib had taken an oath to die as martyrs in the manner of Baba Deep Singh Ji Shaheed fighting to the last drop of their blood.</p>

        <h1>Shaheed Bhai Avtar Singh Brahma</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Arial Nova'">
          One of the most famous and effective Khalsa generals to have taken part in the Sikh Liberation Movement was Bhai Avtar Singh Brahma. The name of “Brahma” used to strike terror into the hearts of Indian Security Forces. Bhai Brahma also had a very special relationship with Canadian and other Western Singhs who had gone to fight for Sikh Freedom. Bhai Avtar Singh was a true Nihang Singh of Guru Gobind Singh and when the Panth needed his head, he was prepared to make the sacrifice.

          Bhai Avtar Singh Brahma was born in 1951 in village Brahmpura, which falls in the Tarn Taran area of Amritsar district. Bhai Brahma’s parents were Sardar Sohan Singh and Mata Chanan Kaur. Bhai Avtar Singh was the youngest of four brothers. His three elder brothers, Sardar Balkar Singh, Sardar Sadha Singh and Sardar Hardev Singh continue to live in the village and farm for a living.

          Bhai Amrik Singh was born in 1948, he is the son of Sant Kartar Singh Bhindranwale who was the chief of the Bhindranwale Mehta Jatha. Bhai Sahib had passed his M.A. in Punjabi from Khalsa College at Amritsar. After this he began research work for his PHD.

          He was well versed in Gurbani and Sikh literature. He devoted much of his life for Sikh missionary activities. Bhai Amrik Singh was also one of the Sikh community’s most prominent leaders along with Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.

          Bhai Sahib was married to Bibi Harmeet Kaur, Bhai Sahib has two daughters and one son, his eldest daughter is Bibi Satwant Kaur who was around 6 years old when Operation Bluestar took place. His second daughter was Paramjit Kaur and she was 3 years old in 1984 and Bhai Sahib’s son Tarlochan Singh was born in August 1984, a few months after Bhai Sahib attained shaheedi. Bhai sahib told his daughters to have a nitnemi and Gursikhi jeevan. Bibi Satwant Kaur was only 4yrs and 6months old when she was given Amrit.

          Bhai Sahib’s family knew Sant Ji’s family beforehand they were good family friends. When Sant Kartar Singh Ji passed away many Singh’s wanted Bhai Amrik Singh to take his place, but Bhai Sahib refused and said that there was no other better person to fulfil this role than Sant Jarnail Singh Ji Khalsa Bhindranwale.

          Khalistan Liberation Force

          Shaheed Bhai Jugraj Singh ‘Toofan’ was born in 1971 at village Cheema Khurd. His father Sardar Mahinder Singh, Jugraj Singh have five sisters, being the only son of his parents.

          Jugraj Singh was 14-15 years of age in when Indira Gandhi ordered the army attack on Sri Harmandir Sahib in 1984. The destruction of Sri Akal Takhat Sahib left Jugraj Singh saddened and his religious emotions came to the boiling point, he decided to fight against the injustice being carried out against Sikh’s in their own country and he dedicated his life to the Sikh cause from 1984 to April 1990.

          Bhai Jugraj Singh used his weapons to protect people and punish those who implicated atrocities on Sikh faith. At a young age he spent some time in Nabha security jail with Shaheed Bhai Manbir Singh Chaheru and Shaheed Major Baldev Singh Ghuman. Singh’s in jail would tell Jugraj Singh that he is too young and only son of their parents so he should stay at home and take care of the family instead of jumping in the Sikh fight against the state. However, Bhai Sahib always said that he wanted to serve the Sikh panth and he did not care if that cost him his life.
